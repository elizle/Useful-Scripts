# Useful-Scripts
## These are scripts that I have made over the last few years while learning Powershell/Windows Administration.
#### They have all been written over different periods of time. Some of the scripts were written in a hurry and still need the code comments added. I tried to take all of the specific file server information out of them. They may need adapted to work correctly in your environment.
